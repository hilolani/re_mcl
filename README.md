# re_mcl
This is a Python program for Markov Clustering (MCL) that supports not only dense matrices (to be automatically converted to CSR format) but also sparse matrices (can read Matrix Market mtx files). The convergence process can also be reproduced using the logger protocol. Run

pip install git+https://github.com/hilolani/re_mcl.git

to use this program.
We plan to implement Recurrent MCL (RMCL) and Latent adjacency clustering, developed at the former Akama Laboratory at Tokyo Institute of Technology, in this repository going forward.
